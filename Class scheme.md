# Shendi

For the time being, I have these objectives.

### Upcoming development - Alpha stage:
- Able to generate PC of level 1
- Realtime editable buttons and selections
- Export character in .Shendi format
- Export fillable pdf.
- Manage homebrew content.

### Beta Stage:
- Level up
- Parse Nethys and load up all the data

### After 1.0 Release:
- Animal Companions and familiars
- Monsters
> #### Animal Companions(NethysDB)
> - Name (I mean race, or type of animal)
> - Nickname (the name you put it to your ~~pokemon~~ pet)
> - (size, abilities, melee actions, ranged actions, damage, hitpoints, proficient skills, Senses, Speed, especial abilities, Advanced Maneuver)
> #### Familiars(NethysDB)
> 
- PlayMode
> - Actions will have a boolean to know if the skill-action can be used trained/untrained
> - Build an enumerator / optional variable to receive the critical success, success failure and critical failure. So I can jump up or down depending on the number rolled. 
> - Bonuses and penalties, 4 boxes for each, and pick the highest or lowest possible. (Although it would be cool to show it or pick one of the available list)
> * Attacks
> * Rounds and turns (It's not a combat app yet)
> * roll Initiative(skill): int

# Questions:

* Class Features: Can I get any help here? Might be a especial class for "class features(NethysDB)

### Things to investigate
* Why spell.json has a "source" and "components" but they are equal?
