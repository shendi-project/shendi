###### Built in python

## About
Hi!, this is a project by AucaCoyan#9411. Contact me at Discord.

**I'm pretty new to programming, so expect a bunch of bugs and spaghetti code.**

For the time being, I have these objectives before I hit the alpha, beta or pre-release versions (I'll decide that later).

Upcoming development:
- Importing and exporting PF2 characters.
- Manage homebrew content.


## Other stuff to check

###### There is an [API for Nethys](https://github.com/SargntSprinkles/Pathfinder-2e-API)
It'd be cool if *shendi* could grab data from Nethys and parse it into the database. This would work only for the mechanics currently working on *shendi*, if there is any new mechanic, we will need to code that.
Some kind of "PF-updater" that downloads everything and updates the database would also be good.
